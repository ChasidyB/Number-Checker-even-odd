# Number Checker

A beginner‑friendly Python program that asks the user for a number and tells them whether it is **even** or **odd**. The script includes basic input validation and allows the user to check multiple numbers in a row.

## 🧠 How It Works
The program:
1. Asks the user for a number  
2. Converts the input to an integer (or asks again if invalid)  
3. Uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check even/odd  
4. Prints the result  
5. Asks if the user wants to try again
